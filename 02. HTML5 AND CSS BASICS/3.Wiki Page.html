    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>

    <p>
            The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is
            a bear that is found across much of
            northern Eurasia and North America.
            In North America the population of brown
            bears are often called grizzly bears.
            It is one of the largest living terrestrial
            members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size
            only by its closest relative,
            the polar bear (Ursus maritimus),
            which is much less variable in
            size and slightly larger on average.
